# Webpage-Crawler-Visualizer-Ranker
This project was done by me as an assignment in the Python for Everybody Specialization on Coursera. 
I have only worked on Python and SQLite browser in this assignment.
I have deleted the O/P screenshots due to the Coursera Honor Code.
The JS code was pre defined by Dr.Charles Severance (Author of Py4E). 
Contact me if you have any issues or need any assistance.
